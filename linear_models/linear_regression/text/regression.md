## Regression

Regression is used to predict a continuous value as output. It helps to identify trends or find missing data.

The different models can be divided according to the correlation between the input and the output values in

* linear regression models
* non linear regression models

## Simple Linear Regression

For a simple linear regression the correlation between the input and the output values can best be fitted by using a linear equation.

In 2-dim:

The minimal distance between the line and the data points can be calculated by using the least squares method.
