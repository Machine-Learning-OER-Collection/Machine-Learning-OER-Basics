## Style Guide

### Folder structure
Create for each algorithm one folder with subfolders for images, text and code.

### Code
* Start code with a title.
* Add reference.
* List the used libraries.
* Provide link to data source and terms of use. Make sure, that it is compatible with the CC-BY 4.0 license.
* Provide links to relevant functions and helpful information.
* Document the code. 


### Images
* Use svg as file format for the images. For creation and editing the open source software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/de/) can be downloaded.
* Use levels to separate text and image objects in the svg file. This helps to improve the reusability between users with different languages.
* Adjust the canvas size to fit to the image.
* Insert reference in the image like title, author, license with link and source with link. Optionally the CC logo can be added, see [Download](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads/) and [policies](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads/).
* If you reused the image and modified it, indicate it, see [Marking your work with a CC license](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license).
* Insert reference in Inkscape under File > Document Properties > Metadata. 
* Additionally you can provide a gallery in the readme file of the img folder. This simplifies the browsing of the svg files.

Tips for layout:  
* Don`t use the colors green and red to show differences because of color blindness.
* Label diagrams with title.
* Label axes.
* Insert a legend.

### Text snippets
* Use a markdown file format for your text snippets.
* Start with a title.
* Link to the images in the text snippets.
* Use [blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) for the code examples. Add reference.
* Add reference.
