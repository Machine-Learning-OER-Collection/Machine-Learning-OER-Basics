### Statistical Measure

**Skewness**

Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the type and strength of asymmetry in a probability distribution. Any non-symmetric distribution is skewed, right-skewed or left-skewed. You can also speak of positive (right) or negative (left) skewness or symmetrical distribution. Right skewness means that the outliers are to the right; for the left skewness, the outliers are to the left.
